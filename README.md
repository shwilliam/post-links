### **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Instagram has announced that they will be deprecating the API that this project relies on. This means that when that happens this app will break (until work to migrate to the new API is complete). For now, feel free to use this project as you wish!

## Instructions

2. [Get your user ID](https://codeofaninja.com/tools/find-instagram-user-id).
3. [Add your information to our database](https://post-links.netlify.com)
4. In your Instagram post description, include `[link: https://someurl.com]` with the url you want the post to redirect to. You can now access your post overview with working links at `https://post-links.netlify.com/your-username`.
